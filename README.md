# WeightLossForecast

WeightLossForecast is a tool that helps you track your weight loss progress and BMI over time, predicting when you will reach your target weight using a linear regression model. 

It helps monitor your weight and BMI trends visually using scatter plots, and displays goal progress expressed as a percentage and R^2 broken down in simple terms.

The user logs their weight daily or as frequently as desired, which is saved locally, and can be used on both PC/Mac and mobile.
